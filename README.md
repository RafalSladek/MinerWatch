# MinerWatch
A program to make sure your mining software has as near 100% up time as possible.
Released under GPLv3.
Works by checking your workers hashrate directly from your pool. Makes a neat chart from it, and restets your miner if pool reports a hashrate below or equal to your chosen hashrate.

All miners should work, if their .bat are in this format: "miner" "arg1" "arg2" "arg3" etc
.exe only will also work.

Currently supports these pools:
- Nanopool ZCash
- Nanopool Ethereum
- Ethpool Ethereum
